Sorting Algorithm Visualizer:

There is nothing much to be done except to click the run button on VSCode,
select an algorithm and the speed at which you want to see and press the
'Sort' button. Once the list is sorted and you want to visualize another
algorithm. You can simply press the button 'Shuffle' which returns the 
original list and follow the above steps again :)
